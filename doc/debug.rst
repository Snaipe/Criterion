Debugging and Coverage information
==================================

.. _gdb-ref:

.. note::

    The following section assumes you have the relevant debugging server
    installed on your machine. For instance, if you're debugging with gdb,
    you'll need to have ``gdbserver`` installed and available in your PATH.

Debugging with GDB
------------------

In one terminal do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./test --debug=gdb
    Process test created; pid = 20803
    Listening on port 1234

.. note::

    If no argument is passed to --debug, criterion will fall back to the
    appropriate debugging server for your compiler: gdbserver with gcc,
    lldb-server with clang, windbg with msvc.

In another terminal connect to this debug session:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gdb -q ./test
    Reading symbols from ./test...done.
    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    Remote debugging using localhost:1234
    0x00007ffff7dd9d90 in _start() from target:/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    (gdb) continue
    ...
    [Inferior 1 (process 25269) exited normally]
    (gdb) q

After ``continue`` the first test is run:

.. code-block:: bash

    Remote debugging from host 127.0.0.1
    [RUN ] misc::failing
    [----] /path/to/test.c:4: Assertion failed: The expression 0 is false.
    [FAIL] misc::failing: (0,00s)

    Child exited with status 0

And a new process is created for the next test:

.. code-block:: bash

    Process /path/to/test created; pid = 26414
    Listening on port 1234

Connect your remote debugger to this test with ``target remote localhost:1234``
and run the test with ``continue``

To use a different port use ``--debug --debug-transport=<protocol>:<port>``

Debugging with an unsupported debugger
--------------------------------------

If you want to use a debugger that criterion doesn't natively support,
you may use the ``idle`` debugging mode: In this mode, the PID of the
test will be printed, and the test itself will suspend all operations
until a debugger resumes it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./test --debug=idle
    <snip>
    [----] misc::failing: Started test has PID 30587.

On unices, once attached, simply signal the process with SIGCONT to resume
it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo gdb ./test -p 30587
    Attaching to process 30587
    0x00007f9ea3780f3d in raise () from /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0
    (gdb) signal SIGCONT
    Continuing with signal SIGCONT.

    Program received signal SIGCONT, Continued.
    0x00007f9ea3780f5f in raise () from /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0
    (gdb) c
    ...
    (gdb) q

.. _coverage-ref:

Coverage of Criterion tests
---------------------------

To use gcov, you have to compile your tests with the two GCC Options
``-fprofile-arcs`` and ``â€“ftest-coverage``.
